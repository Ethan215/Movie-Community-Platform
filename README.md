## PostgreSQL setup
For now, you need to install postgres locally.
For mac, use:
brew install postgresql

I'm using the credentials joshuayeh with password 'password'
I don't think you need to create a new user to start it though
Now that you have postgres installed, run

psql postgres
CREATE DATABASE moviesdb;

psql -d moviesdb -a -f src/schema.sql
^^^ assuming you are in the project directory ^^^

To make sure this works, run
psql -d moviesdb
\dt

The table "reviews" should show up.

Next, in stil in psql moviesdb:
do the commands:
CREATE USER name WITH PASSWORD 'password';
ALTER USER name WITH SUPERUSER;

Should work.
If this doesn't work, ask josh for questions.

## Setting up server

You need to start the server to connect to the database. to do so, run
npm install pg
npm install cors
node src/server.js
^^^ again, assuming you are in the project directory ^^^

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
