## Introduction
Our platform is an innovative web application designed for film enthusiasts. It offers real-time updates, personalized user interaction, and a suite of engaging features such as customizable summaries, watchlist management, and a community-driven rating and review system. The application utilizes Firebase, a comprehensive app development platform that provides services like real-time databases, authentication, and hosting, to create a seamless user experience.

## Features
1. **Searchable Database**: Provide a searchable database of film titles.
2. **Ratings and Comments**: Engage with the community by rating and discussing your favorite titles.
3. **Watchlist**: Personalize your viewing experience with a private watchlist.
4. **Wrapped Sections**: Explore popular titles in public and private summaries

## Installation
Before running the code for our web application, ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. Firebase tools and FontAwesome icons are also required as part of the setup.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm: If not already installed, download and install from [Node.js Official Website](https://nodejs.org/).
  
### Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Setup

#### Clone the project repository to your local machine
``` git clone [repository-link] ```

#### Navigate to the cloned project directory
``` cd [project-directory] ```

#### Install Firebase SDKs for your application
``` npm install firebase ```

#### Install the Firebase CLI globally
``` npm install -g firebase-tools ```

#### Install FontAwesome libraries for use with React components
```
npm install @fortawesome/react-fontawesome
npm install @fortawesome/free-regular-svg-icons
npm install @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons
```

#### Install the Smooth-Scroll package
``` npm i smooth-scroll ```

## Run React

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
