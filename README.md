## Introduction
Our platform is a web application designed to provide users with a way to view, rate, and review movie released and upcoming movie titles. The application features a number of interactive features including an email login, the ability to add titles to a personal watchlist, adjust review privacy, view other account pages that have left public comments, a search bar to find specific titles, and a "Wrapped" feature which displays a user's top genres and titles based on their account's reviews. A navigation bar is also accessible for users to traverse through titles based on search results, genres, or whether the titles are upcoming. This application utilizes Firebase for authentication, databases, and hosting, as well as TMDB for movie titles, details, and posters.

## Features
1. **Searchable Database**: Provide a searchable database of film titles.
2. **Ratings and Comments**: Engage with the community by rating and discussing your favorite titles.
3. **Watchlist**: Personalize your viewing experience with a private watchlist.
4. **Wrapped Section**: Explore popular titles in public and private summaries
